Each directory language, are indentified with two-letter codes of ISO-639-1
internationalization standard.

The ".mo" files (MACHINE Objects) are BINARY files, than contains the
no-traduced/traduced pairs. These are used by the pygettext code included into
the new pinguino.py file, to traduce the application at run time.

The ".po" files (PORTABLE Objects) are TEXT files, than also contains the
no-traduced/traduced pairs. These are used by developers, to edit all words
needed to traduce the application, before compilate them to ".mo" files.

4.- Instructions to Modify or Update the traduction files

is very easy and simple to.

You only need to do these steps to modify or update your language files:
